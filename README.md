## Getting Started

This was originally a Java Applet written by professor Zerksis D. Umrigar to demonstrate parsing tokens with different context free grammars. I modified the code so it became a stand alone app, as Java Applets have become deprecated. I addition to implementing grammars of my own, I also added features such as being able to rerun parsings during runtime and being able to choose a grammar from a drop down menu.

To use simply compile and run the main class in ParsDemo.Java.

##Windows Vs Linux

Please note that while Java is often touted as a language you can "write once and run everywhere." The Java Swing library runs completely different in Windows and Linux. On top of that, this is almost 30 year old code. Your best bet is to run it in Linux, preferably Ubuntu.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
